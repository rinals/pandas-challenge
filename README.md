# Summarizes the analysis
   * From the calculations of all the school data, it is clear that Charter schools are doing better when it comes to student's academic success and the school budgeting.
   * The top performing charter schools, Cabrera, Griffin, Pena High are consistent in overall passing scores of students in math and reading when calculated through different categories.


# Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations
    1. Charter schools with small or medium size (number of students) are doing better in maths and reading scores of students compared to district schools. However, Wilson High school is the only large size charter school with 2283 students which ranks higher than other district schools in math and reading scores of students with a <$585 spending bin per student.
    
    2. Schools that fall into <$585 or $585 - 630 soending bins has highest overall passing rate of students in maths and reading which indicates good financial strategies. 

    Limitations of the data:
        * There are many factors that affect the success rate of schools. Schools with less number of students have the benefit of efficient staffing within their estimated budget. 
        * The data is only limited to math and reading scores which does not provide a clear idea of how the students of both the types of schools are performing academically.
